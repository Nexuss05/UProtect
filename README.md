# HESTIA: FEEL SAFE
Welcome to Hestia, a new, innovative and easy to use tool for your personal safety and the safety of your loved ones!


## APP DESCRIPTION 
This application is an amazing security tool for all people facing immediate danger or a potential dangerous situation or just feel a sense of discomfort and anxiety.
Thanks to Hestia, you can always have a handy and a very powerful tool for feeling safer and to make the people you love feel safer as well.


## FUNCTIONALITIES:


### 1. Panic Button
Thanks to the just one press of the Panic Button, you can immediately alert the emergency contacts you designated before. 
These emergency contact will immediately receive an SMS that alerts them about your situation of danger.
Along with that, they get precious information such as your position at the moment you pressed the Panic Button.

### 2. Surveillance Mode
Now just by long pressing the same Panic Button you can enter the Surveillance Mode. This mode activates a timer whose duration can be personalized by the user. 
When the timer ends, the user gets a "yes / no" notification asking them if they are safe. If they answer "Yes" the timer starts again, whether you press "No" or don't answer 
at all within a small amount of time, an emergency notification (like the one of the Panic Button) will be sent to the emergency contacts.

### 3. Map 
Thanks to the map system built in our app, every user can easily see all the nearest and open stores and shops, based on the specific user's location and time of the day.
This feature is very powerful in the scenario where you have to wait for someone in a place that is not an unknown and dark street or, in other cases, 
if you need to seek shelter from a threat.

### 4. Courses 
The Courses section acts as a guide with very useful tips & tricks to allow our users to minimize the possibilities of getting into dangerous and uncomfortable situations.
We wanted to cover places and situations that are most incline to develop in stressful scenarios, such as "Nights at the Disco" or "Walking alone at night" 
or even "How to increase your situational awareness"
